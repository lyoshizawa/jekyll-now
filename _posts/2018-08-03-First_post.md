title: First post!  Well real post...
---

Hello!  Today I'm launching my first real(?) website.  All the other ones I tried were the kind a highschooler 20 years ago would try building in pure html.  Yeah, you know the kind.  I have to say github and jekyll has definitely made this a lot easier!  (And prettier) 

Everything is a work in progress, this website, my projects, and well everything.... so hang tight and maybe this'll look somewhat good.
