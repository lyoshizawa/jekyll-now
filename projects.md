This is where I'm going to put my projects and fun stuff!

### [File Compare](https://github.com/lyoshizawa/file_compare)
This is my first project!  Its a python script that compares the output of two unix list directories (or servers), and compares the files based on size and date.  The data is then output into an excel sheet with three tabs:
1. Files that match in size and date
2. Files that **do not** match in size and date
3. Files that only exist in on directory but not the other

### [Data Analyst Nanodegree](https://github.com/lyoshizawa/udacity_data_analyst_nanodegree)
This is a repository of my notes and project files when completing the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree.  Multiple projects were assigned, and I utilized Python, R, and Tableau to create the reports.
